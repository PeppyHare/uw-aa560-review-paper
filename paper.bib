  abstract = {New techniques for remote sensing of solar magnetic fields now provide measures of the magnetic field vector within the solar atmosphere with high angular resolution and high precision. These measurements have enabled a much improved physical understanding of magnetic processes and phenomena in the solar atmosphere, processes that drive the variability of the Sun's radiative and particulate output. The new techniques are reviewed here in the context of the scientific advances they have fostered. Emphasis is given to techniques for inferring the field vector. The quantitative nature of the information needed to explore the solar phenomena sharply constrains the needed precision and angular resolution of the observations. These requirements are reviewed here, along with an assessment of how future improvements in observing capabilities will address these requirements. One may also attribute much of the recent advance in our understanding of solar magnetic fields to ongoing progress in techniques for analysis of the polarization measurements that underlie solar magnetometry. The status and prospects of analysis techniques are also reviewed.},

  abstract = {We report on measurements, made for the first time for an imploding plasma at its stagnation, of the magnetic field spatial distribution. Utilized for the measurements is a spectroscopic technique based on simultaneous recording of each of the left- and right-handed circularly polarized Zeeman emissions. While this method allows for overcoming the Stark- and Doppler-broadenings that obscure the Zeeman splitting, it requires a line of sight that is parallel to the magnetic field lines. To this end, the radial charge-state distribution in the stagnating z-pinch plasma was measured, and the method was employed for emission lines of several selected charge states located in various radial locations. This also allowed for measuring the time-resolved magnetic field radial distribution in a single discharge, which is advantageous for high-energy-density plasma experiments. These distributions were measured at various locations along the pinch axis.}

The design of experiments is then considered taking into account the maximum amount of information which can be obtained from polarimetric measurements. Special attention is devoted to the techniques of polarization modulation (including both progressive and alternating modulation). Different alternative configurations are described which are of special interest because they can be realized in the far infrared and because they allow a measurement of phases rather than amplitudes. The effects of refraction are then briefly considered. Finally, the combination of polarimetry and interferometry on the same instrument is discussed, including the effects of polarization modulation.}

	title = {Principles of Plasma Diagnostics: Second Edition},
	journal = {Plasma Physics and Controlled Fusion},
	abstract = {Although diagnostics are the essential tools of the experimental plasma physicist, there are surprisingly few up-to-date books in this field. Several excellent volumes appeared in the early days of fusion research but these, though containing much material that is still relevant, are now seriously out of date with respect to the substantial advances that have taken place in this field over the past decades. There is of course a vast amount of information in journal articles, conference papers and reviews, but these generally are aimed at the experienced specialist and consequently usually omit, or at most give a quick overview of, the basic principles. Moreover most research papers are concerned either with recent developments or with specific applications of existing techniques making it difficult for a newcomer to the field to find a good introduction to the basic principles. So when the first edition of Ian Hutchinson's book entitled Principles of Plasma Diagnostics appeared some 15 years ago it filled an important niche and quickly established a high reputation.

This book deals with the fundamental physics of plasma diagnostics and develops an understanding of the methods from first principles. Instrumentation and experimental techniques are not discussed in great detail-as the author explains, to do so would have resulted in an unwieldy volume and moreover some of the technology is developing so rapidly that it would soon become outdated-but there is sufficient discussion of the applications to guide the reader towards more specialist literature. So this is not a book that will give a step-by-step account of how to build or operate a diagnostic-but it is the place to turn to in order to learn about the physics underlying the measurement method.

After a brief introduction, the book deals comprehensively with the broad range of diagnostic methods, categorising them according to the physical process or property of the plasma that is used in the measurement. Successive chapters deal with magnetic measurements; plasma particle flux measurements-essentially probe techniques; refractive index methods, including interferometry, polarimetry and reflectometry; emission from free electrons-cyclotron emission, bremsstrahlung etc.; emission from bound electrons-the classic emission spectroscopy; scattering of electromagnetic radiation, incoherent and coherent Thomson scattering; neutral atom diagnostics; and finally a chapter on fast ions and fusion products. There are appendices dealing with various mathematical tools and some special issues, a glossary of symbols and a list of references. And as well as these specific references, the author gives suggestions for further reading and exercises for the student at the end of each chapter. With over 25 years experience in experimental plasma physics, Ian Hutchinson has made significant contributions to the development of the physics of many of the measurement methods that are described here, so this is book of considerable authority and insight. It is well written and will provide much interesting reading for the experienced physicist as well as the student.

The material has been thoroughly revised and updated for this second edition, with new sections and chapters covering recent developments in the field. A small amount of outdated material has been removed, but some additional hundred pages compared to the first edition have extended the work quite considerably. Although the book is based quite firmly on diagnostics for magnetic confinement fusion plasmas, the author's own field of research, the basic principles of these methods are sufficiently general and they are so well explained here that this book will serve as a valuable asset also for physicists working in other areas of plasma research-in particular astrophysical and processing plasmas. The treatment is generally at graduate student level; knowledge of basic plasma physics is useful but not essential to work through the book. But this is much more than a book for the student-it is a valuable work of reference that merits a place on every diagnostician's desk.

Adaptation of the same method for neutron imaging has resulted in a number of propitious systems, which could be potentially employed for neutron detection in security and nuclear decommissioning applications. Recently developed scintillator based coded-aperture imagers reveal that localisation of neutron sources using this technique may be feasible, since pulse shape discrimination algorithms implemented in the digital domain can reliably separate gamma-rays from fast neutron interactions occurring within an organic scintillator. Moreover, recent advancements in the development of solid organic scintillators make them a viable solution for nuclear decommissioning applications as they present less hazardous characteristics than currently dominating liquid scintillation detectors. In this paper existing applications of coded-apertures for radiation detection are critically reviewed, highlighting potential improvements for coded-aperture based neutron source localisation. Further, the suitability of coded-apertures for neutron imaging in nuclear decommissioning is also assessed using Monte-Carlo modelling.}

abstract = {The triggering of rapid small edge localized modes (ELMs) by high frequency pellet injection has been proposed as a method to prevent large naturally occurring ELMs that can erode the ITER plasma facing components (PFCs). Deuterium pellet injection has been used to successfully demonstrate the on-demand triggering of edge localized modes (ELMs) at much higher rates and with much smaller intensity than natural ELMs. The proposed hypothesis for the triggering mechanism of ELMs by pellets is the local pressure perturbation resulting from reheating of the pellet cloud that can exceed the local high-n ballooning mode threshold where the pellet is injected. Nonlinear MHD simulations of the pellet ELM triggering show destabilization of high-n ballooning modes by such a local pressure perturbation.
A review of the recent pellet ELM triggering results from ASDEX Upgrade (AUG), DIII-D, and JET reveals that a number of uncertainties about this ELM mitigation technique still remain. These include the heat flux impact pattern on the divertor and wall from pellet triggered and natural ELMs, the necessary pellet size and injection location to reliably trigger ELMs, and the level of fueling to be expected from ELM triggering pellets and synergy with larger fueling pellets. The implications of these issues for pellet ELM mitigation in ITER and its impact on the PFCs are presented along with the design features of the pellet injection system for ITER.},
